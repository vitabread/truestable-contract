# TrueStable

A Solana lending protocol that allows users to deposit ORE tokens as collateral to borrow USDC.

## Features

- Deposit ORE tokens as collateral
- Borrow USDC against your collateral
- Repay borrowed USDC
- Withdraw collateral when loan-to-value ratio is healthy
- Liquidation system to manage unhealthy positions

## Smart Contract Architecture

The protocol implements the following main functions:

- `initialize_lending_pool`: Create a lending pool with the specified token mints
- `deposit_collateral`: Deposit ORE tokens as collateral
- `borrow_usdc`: Borrow USDC against deposited collateral
- `repay_usdc`: Repay borrowed USDC
- `withdraw_collateral`: Withdraw ORE collateral when position is healthy
- `liquidate_position`: Liquidate unhealthy positions (positions with collateral ratio below threshold)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Solana CLI tools
- Anchor framework
- Node.js and yarn
- Solana wallet (for deploying and testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/truestable.git
cd truestable
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Build the program
```bash
anchor build
```

4. Deploy to localnet or testnet
```bash
anchor deploy
```

## Testing

The protocol has comprehensive test coverage for all major functions including liquidation mechanics.

To run tests:
```bash
anchor test
```

```

## Liquidation Mechanics

The protocol uses the following parameters for liquidation:

- LTV Ratio: 75% (loan-to-value limit for borrowing)
- Liquidation Threshold: 80% (positions with LTV above this can be liquidated)
- Liquidation Bonus: 5% (liquidators receive 5% extra collateral as incentive)

When a position's collateral value decreases or debt value increases such that the LTV ratio exceeds the liquidation threshold, the position becomes eligible for liquidation. Liquidators can repay a portion of the borrowed amount in exchange for collateral plus the bonus.
